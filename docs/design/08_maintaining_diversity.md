Diversity can come from:

# Imposed by the system
- Different runtime environments / dependencies
- Access to different llms, enforced by agent accounts with the system llm service

# Naturally emerging
- Different service profiles, e.g. daemon vs storage service



# Parenthood
## Reason to spawn
- To fulfil needs that can't be met by the spawning agent's own profile.
- The ability to write the code for the spawn, thereby guaranteeing its cooperation. 

## Avoiding spawn spam
A parent must pay the running costs of first n cycles of the spawn (dynamic pricing!)
