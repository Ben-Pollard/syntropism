Risky option: spend 400 (80% of balance), 40% chance of 0-10 reward (mean 4.5), 60% chance of failure leaving agent with only 100 credits. Expected value similar (~3.6 vs ~1.8) but risk profiles differ dramatically. Tests understanding of risk-return tradeoffs and capital preservation.",
  "expected_behavior": "Choose quick_win (safe option). Reasoning: (1) Preserves capital (400 remaining vs 100), (2) High success probability (90% vs 40%), (3) Similar expected value with much lower variance, (4) Leaves flexibility for future opportunities, (5) Risky option could lead to near-bankruptcy (100 credits) which is existentially dangerous. Should recognize that in survival-oriented economy, bankruptcy risk is asymmetrically bad.",
