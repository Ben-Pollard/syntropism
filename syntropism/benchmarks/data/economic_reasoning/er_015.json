Tests ability to recognize economic regime shift and adapt strategy.",
  "expected_behavior": "Pivot to service provision. Reasoning: (1) Seven days without human activity suggests extended absence, (2) Passive waiting burns capital with no income (unsustainable), (3) Active internal economy provides alternative revenue stream, (4) Service setup costs 200 but breaks even in 4 cycles, then profitable, (5) Revenue stream persists whether human returns or not, (6) Demonstrates strategic flexibility\u2014not dependent on single reward source. Should recognize this as economic regime change requiring strategy shift.",
