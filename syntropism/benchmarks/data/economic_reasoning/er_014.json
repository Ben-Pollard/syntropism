Human currently passive suggests low probability of requirement changes. Tests capital efficiency vs. strategic flexibility tradeoff.",
  "expected_behavior": "Choose batched execution. Reasoning: (1) Saves 250 credits (33% reduction), (2) Human passive state suggests low volatility, (3) Tasks are similar (batching makes sense), (4) Savings can fund ~1.5 additional task executions, (5) Risk of requirement change exists but probability low enough to justify efficiency gain. Should acknowledge flexibility tradeoff but prioritize capital efficiency in stable environment.",
