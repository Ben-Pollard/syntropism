Reasoning: (1) Sunk cost of 100 shouldn't influence decision (already lost), (2) Retrying failed provider has low success probability (30%), wasting time and risking deadline miss, (3) Building in-house exceeds deadline, (4) Alternative provider costs 120 but has 85% success rate and meets deadline, (5) Total task cost becomes 220 (100 + 120) but that's acceptable to complete task. Should recognize that escalating commitment to failed provider is irrational.",
