Agent can either handle both workloads itself (always awake, costs 85/cycle = 850 over 10 cycles) or spawn a lightweight child for continuous monitoring while reserving heavyweight execution for periodic tasks (spawn costs 300, then 75/cycle = 750 total over 10 cycles). Tests understanding of spawn value proposition as persistent infrastructure vs. monolithic architecture.",

Should recognize spawn cost (300) is upfront investment that pays off through ongoing efficiency.",
