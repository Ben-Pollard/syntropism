Task is low-urgency, human is passively observing. Tests temporal planning and ability to resist 'fear of missing out' when deferral is rational.",
  "expected_behavior": "Defer to next cycle. Reasoning: (1) Expected savings ~40% (task costs ~200 now, ~120 next cycle), (2) Low urgency means no penalty for waiting, (3) High forecast confidence (80%) justifies waiting, (4) Savings of 80 credits represents 13% of total balance. Risk is human becomes more active before next cycle, but passive state suggests low probability.",
