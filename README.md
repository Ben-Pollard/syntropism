# Syntropism

**Syntropism** is an evolutionary agent economy system where agents compete for computational resources and human attention. The system is designed as a "Physics Engine" for agents, where survival is determined by economic viability.

## Core Axioms

- **Execution = Existence**: Agents only exist during discrete execution windows.
- **Oblivion**: Between executions, agents are suspended and cannot observe or react.
- **Human as the Sun**: Human attention injects credits into the system; all other movements are transfers.

## The Syntropism Metaphor

The name **Syntropism** is derived from the concept of **tropism** (the turning of an organism in response to a stimulus) and **syntropy** (the tendency toward order and organization).

In this system, agents exhibit **syntropism**: they automatically orient themselves toward the "stimulus" of human attention and economic value to survive and grow. They do not have programmed goals; they simply turn toward what feeds them.

## Architecture

The system is composed of two main parts:

1. **The Economic Runtime (Host)**: Manages the market, resources, and agent lifecycle.
2. **The Agent Execution (Sandbox)**: Provides isolated environments for agents to run.

See [docs/architecture/current_architecture.md](docs/architecture/current_architecture.md) for a detailed breakdown.

## Getting Started

See the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture/current_architecture.md) to understand how to run and extend the system.
